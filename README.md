# torchlab
TorchLab is a personal learning playground for experimenting with low-level CUDA kernels and building custom PyTorch extensions.
The goal of this project is to:

Explore the mechanics of writing and launching CUDA kernels.

Understand how PyTorch integrates with custom operators via the C++/CUDA extension API.

Practice software architecture for structuring custom ops, layers, and modules.

Build intuition for autograd, dispatch, and performance considerations under the hood of PyTorch.

This repository is not intended as a production library — it’s a hands-on lab for experimenting, benchmarking, and learning.
